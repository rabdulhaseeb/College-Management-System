The College Management System is a robust software application designed to assist educators in managing administrative tasks efficiently. This system employs advanced Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and virtual functions in C++ to provide functionalities such as secure login, personal information management, course schedules, class information, and student mark assignments.

Key Features:
- Secure Login System with user authentication via email and password.
- Time Management that displays the current date and day of the week using system time.
- Personalized information display including name, email, department, and college details.
- Course Schedule Management offering detailed timing and subject information.
- Class Information with categorized student lists for sections A, B, and C.
- Student Marks Assignment allowing teachers to assign marks to their classes.

Advanced Programming Concepts:
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++ utilizing classes and objects.
- Inheritance where the Teacher class inherits from Login and Syn classes.
- Polymorphism through virtual functions enabling flexible code design.
- Encapsulation ensuring data security and controlled access.
- Abstraction by defining abstract Login class and modeling appropriate classes.
- Composition with the Teacher class delegating responsibilities to Time and Syn classes.

Code Structure:
- Login Interface: Abstract class defining the login method.
- Time Class: Manages current date and day of the week display.
- Syn Class: Handles class-specific student information.
- Teacher Class: Inherits core functionalities for login validation, course management, and marks assignment.
